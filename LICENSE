Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

considerations for the public also apply to creators and the public
should follow them in order to make use of the licensed material.

1. Public License Considerations

   A. Limitations on Enforceability: Creative Commons public licenses
   create a relationship based on copyright, which may not apply
   to other types of rights, such as patent, trademark, privacy,

   copyright only may not address all permissions necessary for
   intended uses.

   B. No warranties: Creative Commons licenses do not provide any
   warranties or guarantees, and all materials licensed are
   provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. Licensors
   make no representations or warranties regarding the licensed
   material.

   C. Termination: Creative Commons licenses can be terminated if the
   recipient breaks the license terms, but this termination does
   not affect others who have received sublicenses.

2. Attribution-ShareAlike Requirements

   A. Attribution: If you share the licensed material, you must: - Retain copyright notices, license notices, and notices of
   disclaimers - Provide the name of the creator and attribution parties - Indicate if you modified the material and retain indication
   of prior modifications - Provide a link to the license - Indicate if you modified the material

   B. ShareAlike: If you remix, transform, or build upon the licensed
   material, you must distribute your contributions under the same
   license as the original.
